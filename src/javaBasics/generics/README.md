# Generics

Allow us to specify type to a class. Hence, we can create a call and specify the datatype the class should accept.

For example java's Collection accept datatype:

- ArrayList<String>
- LinkedList<String>

## Why this is required

This helps developer to write more maintainable code. By mentioning specific type we can track type related issues at compile time.

## When this feature was introduced

After 1.5 version

## Why ArrayList is accepted without datatype

For backward compatibility, ArrayList still works without specifying the object.
